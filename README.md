# Predicting-Movie-Revenue-Repository
Repository containing my capstone project to Springboard, Predicting Movie Revenue. 

The project utilizes a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies) of movies released worldwide in the years between 1986 to 2016. The project attempts to accurately predict budget of movies given movie information like its budget, country of release, genre, starring actor, etc.. 

The project goes over many stages, namely:
